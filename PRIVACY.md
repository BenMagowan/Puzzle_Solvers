## How We Use Data

### Primary Uses

### Processing Location

All data processing occurs:

-   **Locally** in the user's browser
-   **On the client-side** without server transmission
-   **In temporary memory** during active puzzle solving

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

All data is stored exclusively in the user's local browser storage using Chrome's storage API:

-   **Puzzle Solutions**: Cached locally using puzzle type and grid configuration as keys

### Data Retention

-   **Puzzle Solutions**: Retained until manually cleared by user or browser cache cleanup
-   **User Preferences**: Retained until extension is uninstalled or manually reset
